# Javascript Basics
This repo consists of all my programs I created as a part of a Javascript tutorial on Udemy. It is the "JavaScript For Beginners - Learn JavaScript From Scratch" tutorial.

## Lessons
The Lessons folder contains all of the files that were created as part of in-lecture exercises, such as learning about using variables in JavaScript, learning conditional statements, etc. Not all of the files match what was given in the lecture, as I expanded on a few concepts.

## Challenges
The Challenges folder contains all of my work for the "challenges" given. The instructor gave us problems and encouraged us to try to solve them ourselves before working through the solution with him.

## Template
template.html is a template file I created based on the structure the instructor encouraged us (students) to use.
